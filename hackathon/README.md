# Hackathon material

This folder contains sample hackathon materials that you can use for your hackathons.
You can either use current folders, where you will find different challenges for dev-teams and ops-teams, choose a challenge from [this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotHackathon) or come up with your own, based on customer needs and specifications.

Please refer to the various README.md files in the subfolders to better understand the challenges.
